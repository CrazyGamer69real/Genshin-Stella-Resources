Thank you for downloading my mod! If you paid money for this, you got scammed! (this is a free mod)

This is my first (DONE) MOD so please don't be too harsh :]

I made this because there where no other mods that gave Mona cat ears and because https://tenor.com/view/thanos-gif-25117042.

if you have an questions leave a comment on gamebanana and I'll get back to you.
